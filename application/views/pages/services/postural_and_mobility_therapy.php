                            <p>Children who have postural problems are prone to slow and gradual deterioration of their health over time. Proper body symmetry can prove beneficial in the long run with positive outcomes. Interventions in the form of postural and mobility therapy can help slow down, stop, or reverse the deterioration. </p>                  
                            <p>Dr. Habib’s Foster CDC offers individualized and cost-effective postural care and mobility therapy that provides both tangible and intangible benefits in the long term.</p>                  
                            <p>When it comes to the benefits of posture and mobility care, the interventions can reduce the need for invasive and expensive interventions in the future – such as</p>

                            <h3>The importance of posture and mobility</h3>
                            <p>Improper posture can cause pain and discomfort whereas proper posture relieves pain and discomfort. It also enhances self-esteem and confidence. In a nutshell, good posture and proper limb mobility are essential factors for overall physical health. In growing and developing children & adolescents, correcting posture and mobility patterns are crucial aspects of health and well-being.</p>
                            <h3>Postural and Mobility Care</h3>
                            <p>At our Child Development Centre, we address Postural issues and lower limb mobility problems in children and adolescents. Our pediatric physiotherapists play an essential role in the assessment, diagnosis, and management of mobility and postural issues in children. Being experienced, trained, and expert professionals they possess an exceptional understanding of the children’s unique requirements and provide targeted interventions to address their issues.</p>
                            <h3>Comprehensive Assessment and Evaluation</h3>
                            <p>Our expert pediatric physiotherapist thoroughly examines the child physically to check the child’s movement, gait, posture, and muscle strength. A thorough assessment and evaluation may help identify the reason or cause behind the postural and mobility issues in children.</p>
                            <p><b>Functional analysis:</b> in a typical assessment process, our physiotherapist observes and analyzes a child’s movement during activities such as sitting, walking, running, and jumping. Functional analysis may help identify particular areas of concern that need to be taken care of.</p>
                            <p><b>Joint mobility assessment:</b> Physiotherapists look in a child for a range of motions in the joints, muscle strength, and flexibility to identify weak areas.</p>
                            <h3>Customized Treatments and Plans</h3>
                            <p>Our physiotherapists incorporate the findings of their assessments into a customized treatment plan. It is according to the child’s condition, age, and requirements. The treatment plan includes a combination of therapeutic activities including stretches and exercises.</p>
                            <h3>Balance and coordination activities</h3>
                            <p>Both balance and coordination are crucial for the correct posture and proper mobility of limbs. Physiotherapists judiciously select the apt exercises that challenge balance and coordination.</p>
                            <h3>Mobility Improvement</h3>
                            <p>Physiotherapists teach a group of exercises that specifically target some specific areas of the joints’ muscles and soft tissues to improve mobility. Exercises that target the joints improve the strength, stability, flexibility, and mobility of the joints.</p>
                            <h3>Postural correction exercises</h3>
                            <p>The exercises strengthen core muscles, augment alignment, and encourage proper posture during activities.</p>
                            <h3>Functional training</h3>
                            <p>Expert physiotherapists let the child apply their improved mobility and posture to practice in their day-to-day activities. To ensure this they train the child through practical activities that are helpful in real-life situations.</p>
                            <h3>Follow-up Care</h3>
                            <p>Children and their families who come for regular follow-up care witness progress over time. Physiotherapists monitor the progress of a child and make necessary changes to their treatment plan if they find any hindrance in progress or improvements or challenges to the existing regimen. </p>
